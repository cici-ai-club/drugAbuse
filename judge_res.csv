She had\nhypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation which was\nagreeable to her neice and HCP, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **].  She became\npressor dependent while intubated for pressures in the 60s/30s\nand went in to A-fib with RVR (see below).  She was started on\nVancomycin and Zosyn on [**2105-12-7**] for HAP.  Sputum cx and\nbronchoscopy x2 failed to reveal infectious bacteria, but she\nwas kept on these antibiotics given her respiratory status and\npressor dependence.  After much discussion with HCP it was\ndecided that she would not want trachiotomy or PEG tube and\nwould prefer extubation, even if this leads to her demise.  The\ndecision has been made to make pt??????s goals of care comfort\noriented-  no further interventions, no heroic measures.  She\neventually was weaned off pressors on [**2105-12-18**] and was extubated.\n She finished a 14 day course of Vanc and Zosyn on [**2105-12-20**].\nSince then has been afebrile.

She does continue to have a large left\npleural effusion, and right effusion, without clear infectious\netiology. This is most likely from CHF. It was unlikely that\ndoing thoracentesis would help her with improved oxygenation and\nthat the fluid would most likely reaccumulate from CHF. Also\ngiven her kyphotic posture, she would unlikely go over her\ncurrent oxygen saturation level on room air.\n.\n# Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Patient converted to A-fib with\nRVR during her hypoxic respiratory failure.  Her rate was\ninitially controlled with IV diltiazem.  She was started on\namiodarone gtt and converted to sinus on [**2105-12-9**].

Chest CTA revealed large\nbilateral pleural effusions with associated compression\natelectasis. Tachypnea resolved with diuresis with Lasix and\nsupplemental oxygen. He was given Albuterol and Atrovent\nnebulizer treatments, good pulmonary toilet and use of the\nincentive spirrometry were encouraged, and the patient received\nchest PT with improvement in overall respiratory status. Able to\nwean off supplemental oxygen. CXR on [**3-17**] revealed still\nextremely low lung volumes. Hazy opacification at the left base\nis consistent with pleural fluid. Obscuration of the\nhemidiaphragm suggests volume loss in the left lower lobe. The\nright lung was essentially clear and there was no evidence of\npulmonary vascular congestion.\n\nStarting on [**4-12**], he spiked a temperature to 103 PO and his WBC\nincreased from 13 to 23,000.  He had a CT abdomen performed\nwhich demonstrated a left pleural effusion\non the upper cuts of the abdomen. Thoracic surgery was consulted\nfor management of the pleural effusion. On [**2146-4-14**], he underwent\nultrasound-guided thorocentesis and placement of left pleural\npigtail catheter. Plural fluid for culture, gram stain,\ncytology, chemistries, and AFB was sent. The pleural pigtail\ncatheter was removed on [**4-15**]; post-removal CXR revealed minimal\napical and lateral basal pneumothorax without evidence of\ntension. Unchanged minimal atelectasis at the left lung base. A\nfollow-up CXR on [**2146-4-18**] showed continued low lung volumes with\nleft basilar subsegmental atelectasis, likely related to the\nrecent abdominal surgery and ongoing intra-abdominal process. No\nappreciable residual left pneumothorax was seen. The patient\nremained stable from a pulmonary standpoitn thereafter.\nRespiratory toilet, incentive spirrometry, and frequent\nambulation was encouraged.\n.\nGU/FEN: On admission, the patient was made NPO and he received\nvigorous IV fluid rescusitation. A foley catheter was placed.\nAllowed clears on [**3-11**] and [**3-12**], but an NG tube was placed on\n[**3-13**] for increased abdominal distension and emesis resulting\nwith 1400mL bilious output. After successful clamp trial\novernight, the NG tube was discontinued on [**3-15**] in the morning.\nGiven persistent problems with tolerating oral intake, a PICC\nwas placed, and TPN was started on [**2146-3-14**]. With the decision\nto proceed to surgery, TPN was continued through [**2146-4-12**]. When\nnot NPO for procedures, his diet was advanced back to low fat\nregular with good tolerability and intake. When the foley\ncatheter was removed after surgery, he was able to void without\nproblem. Patient's intake and output were closely monitored, and\nIV fluid was adjusted when necessary. Electrolytes were\nroutinely followed, and repleted when necessary.\n.\nGI: Admission liver and pancreatic enzymes were elevated.\nShortly after admission, the patient underwent ultrasound-guided\npseudocyst drainage measuring 1.7 liters of fluid with a\ndrainage catheter left in place to gravity on [**2146-3-10**]. Liver\nand pancreatic enzymes began trending down. Follow-up\nabdominal/pelvic CT on [**3-16**] demonstrated enlargement of the\npreviously seen fluid collection and appearance of the numerous\nnew large collections in the peritoneum. The drained collection\nhad significantly decreased in size. On [**3-18**], the patient\nreturned to Interventional Radiology for drainage of an anterior\ncollection, and placement of a new drainage catheter to gravity.\nThe previous drain was removed, and upper abdominal pseudocyst\nwas succesfully drained with a catheter left in place to\ngravity. Unfortunately, as noted above, he developed an\naccumulating posterior retroperitoneal cyst, which continued to\nprogress, and there was evidence of a disconnected pancreatic\nremnant within it. He underwent external drainage of pancreatic\npseudocyst and extended adhesiolysis as described above. A (L)\nflank drain was left in place. After the surgery, his symptoms\nimproved.\n.\nID: Admission blood cultures were negative. [**3-10**] fluid culture\nhad no growth. On [**3-17**] after receiving FFPs, the patient mounted\na fever with a Tmax 101.5 PO. Blood cultures were negative.\nFluid cutlure from the [**3-18**] drainage also revealed no growth.\nThe patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely\nwatched for signs of infection. Admission MRSA screen was\nnegative. After the [**2146-4-5**] surgery, cultures from the peritoneal\nfluid on [**4-14**], the (L) JP on [**4-19**], and the flank drain on [**4-21**]\nall grew out MRSA. The patient had been started on empiric IV\nVancomycin, Ciprofloxacin, and Flagyl when he spiked a\ntemperature on [**4-14**]. Fluconazole for empiric coverage after the\nthorocentesis was started on [**4-15**]. Flagyl, Cipro, and\nFluconazole were discontinued on [**4-16**]. Cipro restarted on [**4-21**].\nInfectious Disease was consulted for discharge antibiotic\nrecommendations; their input was greatly appreciated. Cipro was\ndiscomntinued, and oral Levofloxacin and Flagyl started on [**4-26**]\nwith Vancomycin continued. At discharge, the patient was sent\nhome on a two week course oral Linezolid, and a total of four\nweeks of oral Levofloxacin and Flagyl.\n.\nENDOCRINE: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout\nhis stay when he was on TPN; sliding scale insulin was\nadministered accordingly. He did not require exogenous insulin.\n.\nHEMATOLOGY: Upon admission, Coumadin was stopped, and the\npatient received 5 untis of Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFPs) prior to\nfluid collection drainage in Intervention Radiology. On [**3-17**],\nFFPs were again administered in preparation for IR drainage of a\nlarge anterior abdominal fluid collection, but was stopped after\nthe patient experienced severe lower back pain after initiation\nof the second unit of FFP. On [**3-18**], he received a total of 4\nunits of FFPs prior to IR drainage of the aforementioned\ncollection. Prior to [**2146-4-5**] surgery, the patient received 2\nunits of PRBCs for a HCT of 22.2. He did not require any further\nblood products after this date. At discharge, his HCT was 23.7.\n.\nPROPHYLAXIS: History left common iliac DVT and HITs. Repeat\nduplex ultra-sound on admission confirmed persistent\nnon-occlusive thrombus in the left common femoral vein; no right\nDVT was seen. Chest CTA did not reveal a PE. On admission,\nCoumadin stopped, and Agatroban started. After the drainage of\nthe collection on [**3-10**], Agatroban was stopped, and Coumadin\nrestarted. Coumadin also restarted after reversal for second\ncollection drainage. After the surgery on [**2146-4-5**], the patient\nwas restarted on Argatroban. He was again converted back to\nCoumadin prior to discharge, at which time the INR was\ntherapeutic at 3.2 on a Coumadin dose of 2.5mg daily. INR goal\n2.5 with a therapeutic range of [**3-2**].\n.\nMOBILITY: The patient worked with Physical and Occupation\ntherapy extensively. By discharge, he was able to ambulate\nindependently. He was discharge home with PT and OT services.\n.\nAt the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile\nwith stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular\ndiet, ambulating with minimal assistance, voiding without\nassistance, and pain was well controlled.  He was discharged\nhome with VNA and PT services.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\nexacerbation:  The patient was initially admitted to the\nGeneral Medical Service for a presumed chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease exacerbation in the setting of a upper\nrespiratory infection with negative DFAs for influenza A and\nB.  Subsequently the patient was transferred to the Intensive\nCare Unit and intubated for hypercapnic respiratory failure\nand was continually treated with Levofloxacin, steroids and\nnebulized Albuterol and Atrovent for this chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease exacerbation with full ventilatory support.\nSeveral days into the Intensive Care Unit course bile\ncultures for influenza came back positive.  The patient\ncompleted a course of Levofloxacin and was briefly extubated\nfor two to three days with recurrent respiratory failure,\nreintubated and eventually underwent tracheostomy.  On the\nday of discharge the patient's chest x-ray remained clear.\nThe patient was afebrile and tolerating recurrent spontaneous\nbreathing trials on trach mask with intermittent requirement\nof pressure support ventilation.

Cardiovascular:  The patient developed positive\nintubation hypotension and intermittently required pressures\nfor support of his blood pressure throughout his Intensive\nCare Unit course.  The patient also developed rapid atrial\nfibrillation during his Emergency Department course that was\ninitially treated with Diltiazem.  The patient was placed on\nDiltiazem drip and required intermittent boluses of Diltiazem\nthroughout his Intensive Care Unit course.  After extubation\nthe patient was switched to po Metoprolol of which he was\nmaintained as an outpatient for his known history of\nparoxysmal atrial fibrillation and supraventricular\ntachycardia.

His vent settings were weaned and plan\nfor extubation on [**5-1**] was moved up after he bit through the\ntubing to inflate the cuff.  He was extubated after 9 days and\nhis respiratory status continue to improve.  EEG obtained showed\nno epileptiform activity.  Patient had stable respiratory for\nthe duration of his hospitalization following extubation.\n\n# Acute Renal Failure: His creatinine began rising prior to\ntransfer from a baseline of 1.3, and he developed oliguric renal\nfailure.  Renal was consulted and their analysis of his urine\nwas consistent with ATN secondary to sepsis, though there was no\nclear documentation of hypotension from the OSH.  He had to be\nstarted on HD ([**2165-4-26**]) for volume overload and hyperkalemia. At\nthat point his creatinine was 9.8. He continued on HD and\neventually a temporary dialysis catheter was placed (on [**5-2**])and\nthe femoral HD catheter was pulled. His urine output improved,\nalthough his need for HD continued.  The patient had another\ndialysis catheter placed on [**5-15**] for HD, with subsequent\nself-removal secondary to agitation.  A tunnelled catheter HD\nline was placed on [**2165-5-17**] for resumption of HD.  The patient\ncontinued receiving HD 3 times weekly on the floor, and pt's\ncreatinine was 2.2 at time of discharge.  The patient will\ncontinue HD following discharge and will be followed by the\nnephrology service.\n\n# Hypertension: After septic picture resolved, patient was\nhypertensive to 200s/80s.  His losartan was held for renal\nprotection in hopes that his renal function would recover.  He\nwas started on metoprolol and hydralizine with better control.\nPt's HTN was managed well on the floor following ICU transfer\nwith the current medication regimen at discharge.\n\n# L foot ulcer: Likely seeding to blood causing sepsis. ESR and\nCRP very high and will monitor with Abx treatment for\nosteomyelitis.\n- Podiatry and vascular surgery were consulted and stated they\nwould defer amputation and await stabilization/abx treatment of\npatient prior to surgery.\n- no intervention was pursued, as patient improved clinically on\nfloor on vancomycin\n- pt will have ID follow up on [**6-5**]\n\n# Right hip OA: significant source of pain and had required\nlarge doses of narcotics prior to admission.  Per family, the\nplan was to replace his hip, but he was battling recurrent\ninfections from L toe delaying this.  Morphine PO with scheduled\ntylenol proved an effective regimen for his pain.\n\n# Large bowel obstruction:  A KUB demonstrated a distended\ntransverse colon concerning for ileus in the setting of large\nnarcotic use for R hip pain.  General surgery was consulted and\nfelt that it was improving and did not require surgical\nintervention. He eventually began stooling again after PO narcan\nwas started and with an aggressive bowel regimen.  Following\ntransfer to floor, constipation resolved with bowel regimen and\nchange in opiate use.\n\n# CAD s/p IMI: Ruled out for MI at OSH and was continued on\nASA/plavix.  He was not on a beta blocker or statin at home for\nunclear reasons.\n\n# DM:  Managed initially with an insulin drip because of\nelevated finger sticks and converted to a sliding scale.  [**Last Name (un) **]\nconsulted and placed patient on a basal bolus regimen with good\ncontrol at time of discharge.

The day after admission ([**6-7**]) she was intubated for\nhemodynamic control(Afib RVR 150s), pain control, and for\npotential procedure for a possible pericardial window.  From a\nrespiratory prospective she was comfortable prior to intubation\nwhich was done under rapid sequence given signs of early\ntamponade.  She was extubated without event when it was\ndetermined that cardiology did not think her pericardal effusion\nneeded to be drained.  Instead, cardiology recommended serial\nEcho's to follow the effusions size.  An echo on [**6-14**] showed\nthat the effusion was reduced in size compared to prior imaging.\n.\n#Afib with RVR: The Patient has a history of lone atrial\nfibrillation.
