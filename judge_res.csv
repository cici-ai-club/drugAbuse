She had\nhypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation which was\nagreeable to her neice and HCP, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **].  She became\npressor dependent while intubated for pressures in the 60s/30s\nand went in to A-fib with RVR (see below).  She was started on\nVancomycin and Zosyn on [**2105-12-7**] for HAP.  Sputum cx and\nbronchoscopy x2 failed to reveal infectious bacteria, but she\nwas kept on these antibiotics given her respiratory status and\npressor dependence.  After much discussion with HCP it was\ndecided that she would not want trachiotomy or PEG tube and\nwould prefer extubation, even if this leads to her demise.  The\ndecision has been made to make pt??????s goals of care comfort\noriented-  no further interventions, no heroic measures.  She\neventually was weaned off pressors on [**2105-12-18**] and was extubated.\n She finished a 14 day course of Vanc and Zosyn on [**2105-12-20**].\nSince then has been afebrile.

She does continue to have a large left\npleural effusion, and right effusion, without clear infectious\netiology. This is most likely from CHF. It was unlikely that\ndoing thoracentesis would help her with improved oxygenation and\nthat the fluid would most likely reaccumulate from CHF. Also\ngiven her kyphotic posture, she would unlikely go over her\ncurrent oxygen saturation level on room air.\n.\n# Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Patient converted to A-fib with\nRVR during her hypoxic respiratory failure.  Her rate was\ninitially controlled with IV diltiazem.  She was started on\namiodarone gtt and converted to sinus on [**2105-12-9**].

Chest CTA revealed large\nbilateral pleural effusions with associated compression\natelectasis. Tachypnea resolved with diuresis with Lasix and\nsupplemental oxygen. He was given Albuterol and Atrovent\nnebulizer treatments, good pulmonary toilet and use of the\nincentive spirrometry were encouraged, and the patient received\nchest PT with improvement in overall respiratory status. Able to\nwean off supplemental oxygen. CXR on [**3-17**] revealed still\nextremely low lung volumes. Hazy opacification at the left base\nis consistent with pleural fluid. Obscuration of the\nhemidiaphragm suggests volume loss in the left lower lobe. The\nright lung was essentially clear and there was no evidence of\npulmonary vascular congestion.\n\nStarting on [**4-12**], he spiked a temperature to 103 PO and his WBC\nincreased from 13 to 23,000.  He had a CT abdomen performed\nwhich demonstrated a left pleural effusion\non the upper cuts of the abdomen. Thoracic surgery was consulted\nfor management of the pleural effusion. On [**2146-4-14**], he underwent\nultrasound-guided thorocentesis and placement of left pleural\npigtail catheter. Plural fluid for culture, gram stain,\ncytology, chemistries, and AFB was sent. The pleural pigtail\ncatheter was removed on [**4-15**]; post-removal CXR revealed minimal\napical and lateral basal pneumothorax without evidence of\ntension. Unchanged minimal atelectasis at the left lung base. A\nfollow-up CXR on [**2146-4-18**] showed continued low lung volumes with\nleft basilar subsegmental atelectasis, likely related to the\nrecent abdominal surgery and ongoing intra-abdominal process. No\nappreciable residual left pneumothorax was seen. The patient\nremained stable from a pulmonary standpoitn thereafter.\nRespiratory toilet, incentive spirrometry, and frequent\nambulation was encouraged.\n.\nGU/FEN: On admission, the patient was made NPO and he received\nvigorous IV fluid rescusitation. A foley catheter was placed.\nAllowed clears on [**3-11**] and [**3-12**], but an NG tube was placed on\n[**3-13**] for increased abdominal distension and emesis resulting\nwith 1400mL bilious output. After successful clamp trial\novernight, the NG tube was discontinued on [**3-15**] in the morning.\nGiven persistent problems with tolerating oral intake, a PICC\nwas placed, and TPN was started on [**2146-3-14**]. With the decision\nto proceed to surgery, TPN was continued through [**2146-4-12**]. When\nnot NPO for procedures, his diet was advanced back to low fat\nregular with good tolerability and intake. When the foley\ncatheter was removed after surgery, he was able to void without\nproblem. Patient's intake and output were closely monitored, and\nIV fluid was adjusted when necessary. Electrolytes were\nroutinely followed, and repleted when necessary.\n.\nGI: Admission liver and pancreatic enzymes were elevated.\nShortly after admission, the patient underwent ultrasound-guided\npseudocyst drainage measuring 1.7 liters of fluid with a\ndrainage catheter left in place to gravity on [**2146-3-10**]. Liver\nand pancreatic enzymes began trending down. Follow-up\nabdominal/pelvic CT on [**3-16**] demonstrated enlargement of the\npreviously seen fluid collection and appearance of the numerous\nnew large collections in the peritoneum. The drained collection\nhad significantly decreased in size. On [**3-18**], the patient\nreturned to Interventional Radiology for drainage of an anterior\ncollection, and placement of a new drainage catheter to gravity.\nThe previous drain was removed, and upper abdominal pseudocyst\nwas succesfully drained with a catheter left in place to\ngravity. Unfortunately, as noted above, he developed an\naccumulating posterior retroperitoneal cyst, which continued to\nprogress, and there was evidence of a disconnected pancreatic\nremnant within it. He underwent external drainage of pancreatic\npseudocyst and extended adhesiolysis as described above. A (L)\nflank drain was left in place. After the surgery, his symptoms\nimproved.\n.\nID: Admission blood cultures were negative. [**3-10**] fluid culture\nhad no growth. On [**3-17**] after receiving FFPs, the patient mounted\na fever with a Tmax 101.5 PO. Blood cultures were negative.\nFluid cutlure from the [**3-18**] drainage also revealed no growth.\nThe patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely\nwatched for signs of infection. Admission MRSA screen was\nnegative. After the [**2146-4-5**] surgery, cultures from the peritoneal\nfluid on [**4-14**], the (L) JP on [**4-19**], and the flank drain on [**4-21**]\nall grew out MRSA. The patient had been started on empiric IV\nVancomycin, Ciprofloxacin, and Flagyl when he spiked a\ntemperature on [**4-14**]. Fluconazole for empiric coverage after the\nthorocentesis was started on [**4-15**]. Flagyl, Cipro, and\nFluconazole were discontinued on [**4-16**]. Cipro restarted on [**4-21**].\nInfectious Disease was consulted for discharge antibiotic\nrecommendations; their input was greatly appreciated. Cipro was\ndiscomntinued, and oral Levofloxacin and Flagyl started on [**4-26**]\nwith Vancomycin continued. At discharge, the patient was sent\nhome on a two week course oral Linezolid, and a total of four\nweeks of oral Levofloxacin and Flagyl.\n.\nENDOCRINE: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout\nhis stay when he was on TPN; sliding scale insulin was\nadministered accordingly. He did not require exogenous insulin.\n.\nHEMATOLOGY: Upon admission, Coumadin was stopped, and the\npatient received 5 untis of Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFPs) prior to\nfluid collection drainage in Intervention Radiology. On [**3-17**],\nFFPs were again administered in preparation for IR drainage of a\nlarge anterior abdominal fluid collection, but was stopped after\nthe patient experienced severe lower back pain after initiation\nof the second unit of FFP. On [**3-18**], he received a total of 4\nunits of FFPs prior to IR drainage of the aforementioned\ncollection. Prior to [**2146-4-5**] surgery, the patient received 2\nunits of PRBCs for a HCT of 22.2. He did not require any further\nblood products after this date. At discharge, his HCT was 23.7.\n.\nPROPHYLAXIS: History left common iliac DVT and HITs. Repeat\nduplex ultra-sound on admission confirmed persistent\nnon-occlusive thrombus in the left common femoral vein; no right\nDVT was seen. Chest CTA did not reveal a PE. On admission,\nCoumadin stopped, and Agatroban started. After the drainage of\nthe collection on [**3-10**], Agatroban was stopped, and Coumadin\nrestarted. Coumadin also restarted after reversal for second\ncollection drainage. After the surgery on [**2146-4-5**], the patient\nwas restarted on Argatroban. He was again converted back to\nCoumadin prior to discharge, at which time the INR was\ntherapeutic at 3.2 on a Coumadin dose of 2.5mg daily. INR goal\n2.5 with a therapeutic range of [**3-2**].\n.\nMOBILITY: The patient worked with Physical and Occupation\ntherapy extensively. By discharge, he was able to ambulate\nindependently. He was discharge home with PT and OT services.\n.\nAt the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile\nwith stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular\ndiet, ambulating with minimal assistance, voiding without\nassistance, and pain was well controlled.  He was discharged\nhome with VNA and PT services.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\nexacerbation:  The patient was initially admitted to the\nGeneral Medical Service for a presumed chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease exacerbation in the setting of a upper\nrespiratory infection with negative DFAs for influenza A and\nB.  Subsequently the patient was transferred to the Intensive\nCare Unit and intubated for hypercapnic respiratory failure\nand was continually treated with Levofloxacin, steroids and\nnebulized Albuterol and Atrovent for this chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease exacerbation with full ventilatory support.\nSeveral days into the Intensive Care Unit course bile\ncultures for influenza came back positive.  The patient\ncompleted a course of Levofloxacin and was briefly extubated\nfor two to three days with recurrent respiratory failure,\nreintubated and eventually underwent tracheostomy.  On the\nday of discharge the patient's chest x-ray remained clear.\nThe patient was afebrile and tolerating recurrent spontaneous\nbreathing trials on trach mask with intermittent requirement\nof pressure support ventilation.

Cardiovascular:  The patient developed positive\nintubation hypotension and intermittently required pressures\nfor support of his blood pressure throughout his Intensive\nCare Unit course.  The patient also developed rapid atrial\nfibrillation during his Emergency Department course that was\ninitially treated with Diltiazem.  The patient was placed on\nDiltiazem drip and required intermittent boluses of Diltiazem\nthroughout his Intensive Care Unit course.  After extubation\nthe patient was switched to po Metoprolol of which he was\nmaintained as an outpatient for his known history of\nparoxysmal atrial fibrillation and supraventricular\ntachycardia.

His vent settings were weaned and plan\nfor extubation on [**5-1**] was moved up after he bit through the\ntubing to inflate the cuff.  He was extubated after 9 days and\nhis respiratory status continue to improve.  EEG obtained showed\nno epileptiform activity.  Patient had stable respiratory for\nthe duration of his hospitalization following extubation.\n\n# Acute Renal Failure: His creatinine began rising prior to\ntransfer from a baseline of 1.3, and he developed oliguric renal\nfailure.  Renal was consulted and their analysis of his urine\nwas consistent with ATN secondary to sepsis, though there was no\nclear documentation of hypotension from the OSH.  He had to be\nstarted on HD ([**2165-4-26**]) for volume overload and hyperkalemia. At\nthat point his creatinine was 9.8. He continued on HD and\neventually a temporary dialysis catheter was placed (on [**5-2**])and\nthe femoral HD catheter was pulled. His urine output improved,\nalthough his need for HD continued.  The patient had another\ndialysis catheter placed on [**5-15**] for HD, with subsequent\nself-removal secondary to agitation.  A tunnelled catheter HD\nline was placed on [**2165-5-17**] for resumption of HD.  The patient\ncontinued receiving HD 3 times weekly on the floor, and pt's\ncreatinine was 2.2 at time of discharge.  The patient will\ncontinue HD following discharge and will be followed by the\nnephrology service.\n\n# Hypertension: After septic picture resolved, patient was\nhypertensive to 200s/80s.  His losartan was held for renal\nprotection in hopes that his renal function would recover.  He\nwas started on metoprolol and hydralizine with better control.\nPt's HTN was managed well on the floor following ICU transfer\nwith the current medication regimen at discharge.\n\n# L foot ulcer: Likely seeding to blood causing sepsis. ESR and\nCRP very high and will monitor with Abx treatment for\nosteomyelitis.\n- Podiatry and vascular surgery were consulted and stated they\nwould defer amputation and await stabilization/abx treatment of\npatient prior to surgery.\n- no intervention was pursued, as patient improved clinically on\nfloor on vancomycin\n- pt will have ID follow up on [**6-5**]\n\n# Right hip OA: significant source of pain and had required\nlarge doses of narcotics prior to admission.  Per family, the\nplan was to replace his hip, but he was battling recurrent\ninfections from L toe delaying this.  Morphine PO with scheduled\ntylenol proved an effective regimen for his pain.\n\n# Large bowel obstruction:  A KUB demonstrated a distended\ntransverse colon concerning for ileus in the setting of large\nnarcotic use for R hip pain.  General surgery was consulted and\nfelt that it was improving and did not require surgical\nintervention. He eventually began stooling again after PO narcan\nwas started and with an aggressive bowel regimen.  Following\ntransfer to floor, constipation resolved with bowel regimen and\nchange in opiate use.\n\n# CAD s/p IMI: Ruled out for MI at OSH and was continued on\nASA/plavix.  He was not on a beta blocker or statin at home for\nunclear reasons.\n\n# DM:  Managed initially with an insulin drip because of\nelevated finger sticks and converted to a sliding scale.  [**Last Name (un) **]\nconsulted and placed patient on a basal bolus regimen with good\ncontrol at time of discharge.

Shock was\nrefractory to fluid boluses; received normal saline and water\nwith bicarb given renal failure.  Blood cultures eventually grew\nout MRSA, successive cultures negative until [**2124-3-10**], with\n[**2124-3-10**] culture growing vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus.\nDuring this time, patient was actually weaned off pressors.  The\nright subclavian triple lumen was removed and a right internal\njugular triple lumen was placed.  Goals of care were discussed\nwith family, who requested continued aggressive treatment.\nLinezolid replaced vancomycin for VRE bacteremia. The patient's\npressures stabilized and pressors were discontinued.  He did not\nhave further hypotension after transfer to the oncology floor.\n\n# MRSA/VRE bacteremia: S/p line removals; Patient completed 15\nday course of linezolid.  Also added Meropenem on [**3-24**] given MS\ndecline and asterixis.  Antibiotics were d/c'd on [**3-25**] and\npatient has been stable, afebrile without leukocytosis since.\nRepeat blood and urine cultures have been negative.\n\n# partial/early SBO: On [**3-25**] patient developed worsening\nabdominal distention and confusion.  This early SBO was likely\ndue to narcotics though concerning that is ongoing and limiting\nnutrition. MRI head with improved findings. An NGT was placed\nfor 24 hours and the patient's MS cleared as did his SBO.  There\nwas initially some concern for messenteric ischemia given guiaic\npositive stool, known necrotic fingers and subsequent CT abd\nfindings, so GI and surgery were consulted.  Patient however\nsoon improved clinically so further work-up with colonoscopy was\nnot done.  He was able to tolerate a regular diet for 48H prior\nto discharge. A PICC had been placed for access and for ability\nto start TPN if needed, however TPN was never started.\n\n# Anemia: likely multifactorial due to poor nutrition, acute\nnutrition, and marrow suppression.  Patient is also FOB+ s/p 2U\nPRBC since [**3-17**]. then another 1U [**3-24**].  He was continued on iron,\nfolate and B12 on [**3-27**].

Patient was treated\nwith wound care and transitioned to a fentanyl patch with\nbreakthrough morphine for pain.\n\n# thrombocytopenia: Resolved. Likely due to myelosuppression.\n\n# coagulopathy: Patient was supplemented with vitamin K X3 days\nto decrease his INR.\n\n#  Respiratory failure- Patient was intubated electively in\nsetting of persistent hypervolemia and renal failure.\nMaintained on minimal ventilatory support during dialysis.\nPatient received antibiotic coverage for aspiration pneumonia.\nThe patient was extubated on [**2124-3-15**] and continued to improve\nsignificantly. The patient was called out to the OMED floor team\nfor further managment.\n\n#. ARF: IL-2 mediated ARF most likely, however prerenal or\npostrenal etiology also possible.  K wnl, phos elevated though\nstable from last draw.  Patient likely had IL-2 induced renal\ninjury, with possible ischemic acute tubular necrosis.  Despite\naggressive fluids, renal function did not improve.  Patient was\nshowing signs of uremia and hypervolemia, and continuous\n[**Last Name (un) **]-venous hemodialysis was started following intubation and\nplacement of HD line.  On the last days of admission he did not\nrequire diuresis and continued to auto-diurese with a creatinine\nof 1.1-1.3. He was not continued on his anti-hypertensives as\nhis SBPs were 130-140. Mr. [**Known lastname 2795**] should have his renal function\nchecked as an outpatient in the next 1-2 weeks. If there are\nconcerns with worsening kidney function as an oupatient, he\nshould be followed by renal.\n\n#  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response- Occurred\non morning of [**2124-3-7**].  Became more hypotensive, received two\nattempts at DC cardioversion, transient sinus rhythm restored,\nthen converted back into a. fib.  Amiodarone load and drip was\nstarted.  Converted to sinus rhythm day later, maintained on\namio drip.  Cardiac enzymes were flat, lower extremity\nultrasound negative for DVT.  Repeat TTE showed no right heart\nstrain. The amiodarone drip was discontinued and the patient\nremained in normal sinus rhythm.\n\n#. HA/MS changes: Known metastatic disease to brain and IL-2 can\ncause swelling.  He is AOx3, though slightly agitated.  Clinical\npicture not c/w meningitis/encephalitis and most likely\ntoxic-metabolic.  CT head showed slight improvement in\nmetastatic disease, less vasogenic edema.  Lumbar puncture was\ndeferred given intracranial mass. As patient stayed on the\noncology floor his mental status gradually returned to [**Location 213**].\nHe can have a formal neurocognitive outpatient work-up if deemed\nnecessary by his PCP.\n\n# skin/eye/mucous membrane breakdown: Patient developed\nsignificant skin breakdown, particularly on his fingertips\nlikely due to pressors and IL-2.  He was evaluated by plastic\nsurgery and hand x-ray found no need for intervention.  He was\ncontinued on: nystatin, miconazole, benadryl, sarna, Hydrocerin,\nHydrOXYzine, eye drops, Gelclair.\n\n#.

She appeared to be in\ndiscomfort and nauseated.  Her head, eyes, ears, nose, and\nthroat examination was significant for extraocular movements\nwhich were intact.  Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to\nlight and accommodation.  There was no icterus demonstrated.\nThe oropharynx demonstrated mucous membranes were dry.  She\nwas clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart rate was\nregular in rate and rhythm without any associated murmurs,\nrubs, or heart sounds.  Her abdomen was distended,\ntympanitic, with percussion tenderness near the incision.\nBowel sounds were hypoactive.  Extremities had trace edema\nbilaterally.\n\nPERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories\nobtained at the time indicated white blood cell count\nwas 8.5, hematocrit was 51.3, platelets were 508.

It also demonstrated gastric dilatation and one\nsmall air/fluid level in the midabdomen.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the Purple\nSurgery Service and treated with antiemetics, and medication,\nas well as intravenous hydration for possible postoperative\nileus.\n\nOn hospital day two, she was noted to have increasing amounts\nof gastric dilatation and increasing amounts of discomfort,\nstarting at approximately 11 o'clock that afternoon.\n\nShe was subsequently taken to the operating room for\nre-exploration and revision of her jejunostomy tube\nplacement.  Please see the Operative Note per Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 333**]\n[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for details of this operation.\n\nNotably, during the course of this operation her course was\ncomplicated by a aspiration upon anesthesia induction.\nApproximately 2 liters of gastric content was estimated to\nhave entered the lungs and was rapidly suctioned out;\nhowever, attempts at extubation failed, and the patient was\nultimately transferred to the Intensive Care Unit with a\npresumed diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome\nsecondary to her aspiration.\n\nOn [**2128-10-31**], the patient was maintained intubated in\nthe Intensive Care Unit.  On postoperative day one, the\npatient was converted to a prone position in the Intensive\nCare Unit to help improve her respiratory status.  This\ngradually improved.  The patient was returned to a supine\nposition on postoperative day two.  She was gradually weaned\nfrom the ventilator over the next several days until she was\nextubated on postoperative day eight.\n\nOn postoperative day seven, Pseudomonas pneumonia was grown\nfrom her tracheal tube.  She was started on ceftazidime and\nZosyn that was ultimately converted from Zosyn to\nciprofloxacin.  Tube feeds were started on postoperative day\neight and were brought to goal by postoperative day thirteen.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the floor on [**2128-11-12**].\nJust prior to discharge to the floor, it was noted that she\nhad swelling in her right arm.  An ultrasound was undertaken\nto rule out deep venous thrombosis.  A thrombus was seen\nwithin the distal jugular vein; consistent with deep venous\nthrombosis from the right brachial vein to the subclavian.\nThe patient was started on a heparin drip at that time, and\nover the next several days was converted toward Coumadin.  At\nthe time of discharge, however, she was not therapeutic on\nthe Coumadin; potentially from interference from the\nantibiotics she was on, so the patient was ultimately\ndischarged on Lovenox.\n\nOn the final day of the patient's admission, her port was\naccessed.  She was discharged home on tube feeds at 120 cc\nper hour times 15 hours.  She was given oxygen therapy;\npredominately because of anxiety that she was dealing with\nover feelings of air hunger.  She was also given Lovenox\ninjections.  All of this was accomplished through the aid of\na visiting nurse who was going to help the patient with\ndelivery of medications, the Lovenox injections, and the tube\nfeeds, as well as assisting with monitoring Coumadin in\nconcert with the local physician.\n\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.\n\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge status was to home."", 'injection', 1)]}",dict_keys(['basic_info'])

He had a history of\nalcohol use, and had experienced DT's in the past with\nwithdrawal. Consequently, he was maintained on a versed drip and\nmuch of the confusion was attributed to possible withdrawal in\naddition to delerium. With re-evaluation by wake-ups, the\npatient slowly became more attentive and did not have\ntremors/shakes, was following commands and communicated that he\nwas not in any discomfort. After extubation, a full neuro exam\nwas normal including strength/sensation, cranial nerves, DTRs,\ncerebellar exam and speech/memory.\n\nHEENT: The patient was noted to have poor dentition, but no\nsigns of abscess/infection on oral exam. In addition, a CT scan\nof his head was normal and showed no signs of sinusitis.\n\nPULMONARY: His active problems during this admission were\nrespiratory failure, pneumonia, pleural effusion. The main\nconcern for this patient was that of pneumonia, and strep\npneumonia grew in the first sputum culture on admission. He was\nnoted to have a large R pleural effusion, which was tapped, but\ndid not show evidence of empyema. He remained on the ventilator\nfor 17 days. Upon extubation, he did well, had minimal\nsecretions and strong cough, O2 sats in the 90's, work of\nbreathing was easy.\n\nCARDIAC: Active issues during this admission included\nhypotension and atrial fibrillation, with a history of CAD and\nCHF.  The hypotension was not fluid responsive and he required\nlevophed pressor support for the first 15 days of\nhospitalization. This was weened off and he was eventually\nrestarted on all of his home HTN medication. The hypotension was\nfelt to be sepsis physiology, without evidence of new mycardial\ninjury. The atrial fibrillation remained rate controlled, and at\nfirst anticoagulation was held [**3-9**] a supratherapeutic INR.

Further, given her diabetes and her labile blood\npressure, autonomic seizures were of particular concern. She was\nworked up by multiple teams, including Neurology. Per neurology\na head CT was obtained which indicated atrophy w/ mild\nmicroangiopathic changes. She was put on EEG monitoring to\ncapture seizure activity however she did not have an episode\nduring monitoring. Other considerations were her baseline\npsyciatric disorder or medication regimen.

Therefore, most\nlikely etiology of the development of chylous ascites was\nthought to be progressive lymphatic obstruction from RP fibrosis\nleading to increased hydrostatic pressure and leak into the\nperitoneal cavity.  The patient had three therapeutic\nparacentesis on [**11-14**], and [**11-29**] respectively removing 900\ncc, 3L and 1 L of chylous fluid respectively.  The second of\nthese revealed a neutrophil count of 280 so led to a second\ncourse of five days of antibiotics with ciprofloxacin (as the\npatient was on cefepime/vanc when the paracentesis occured)\nwhich completed on [**2196-11-29**].  All cultures remained negative.\nUnfortunately, the patient developed secondary chylothorax from\nfluid tracking up into the pleural space causing respiratory\ndistress.  Attempts were made to slow accumulation of fluid with\nmedical therapies including octreotide and low fat diet then low\nfat TPN but these were unsuccessful.  General surgery was\nconsulted twice and both times said that surgery to attempt to\nimprove lymph drainage would be unsuccessful as structures are\nvery small and diffuse and post-surgical scarring would likely\nbe as damaging as initial insult.  Case was discussed with\nthoracic surgery who thought that without clear damage to\nthoracic duct there was no indication for procedural management.\n Finally, the possibility of lymphangiogram was discussed\nextensively with a possible intervention and balloon dilation of\ncisterna chyli.  Unfortunately, planning MRI would have been\nrequired and given patient's progressively poor respiratory\nstatus this would have required intubation.  As lymphangiogram\nand balloon dilation are extremely uncommon procedures, odds of\nsuccess were not considered high and risk of intubation and\nlikely difficulty extubation was discussed with the family and\npatient and they elected to pursue comfort focused care.  The\npossibility of disease modifying therapy for RP fibrosis was\ndiscussed with rheumatology, but they said there would be no\nrole for the agents used (almost all of which are immune\nsuppressants) in this acutely sick individual and these things\nwould be unlikely to lead to quick turn-around.\n\n2) Chylothorax/Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient was\ninitially noted to be hypoxic soon after admission with desats\nto the low 90's on room air.  He was seen by pulmonary who\nattributed this to ascites and his large abdomen causing\nrestrictive pathology in the setting of his underlying pulmonary\nasbestosis and plaques.  This was supported by his initial PFT's\nthat showed a restrictive pattern.  The patient then became\nprogressively more hypoxic in the setting of an expanding right\nsided pleural effusion and a large amount of compressive\natelectasis.  He was desatting to the low 90's on 4L O2 by nasal\ncannula when he had his first thoracentesis on [**2196-11-10**] with\nconsiderable improvement after the procedure.  By [**11-12**], however,\nhe had reaccumulated almost completely and by [**11-13**] was\ndesaturating again so that an ABG showed of O2 of around 53.\nTherefore, he was transferred to the unit while he awaited a\nsecond thoracentesis.  As he reaccumulated quickly again after\nthat thoracentesis decision was made to place a pigtail\ncatheter, which was placed on [**2196-11-15**].  Over the ensuing days\nthe patient continued to put out greater than one liter of\nchylous fluid per 24 hour period despite the various\ninterventions meant to reduce chylous ascites mentioned (low fat\ndiets, octreotide, etc...).  On [**2196-11-29**] a pleurodesis was\nattempted in hopes of allowing eventual removal of the chest\ntube though interventional pulmonology thought this had a very\nlow probability of being successful.  After the second\nthoracentesis the patient remained dependent on at least 4L of\noxygen by nasal cannula to keep sats> 90%.  On [**11-26**] he\ndesaturated to the 80's on 6L in the context of worsening\ninfiltrates bilaterally but this seemed to improve with holding\nTPN and was ultimately thought most likely due to volume\noverload. However, on the day of expected discharge ([**11-30**]), his\nrespiratory status worsened (oxygen saturation of 90-92% on\nnon-rebreather) and he did not wish to use the mask. Given that\ncomfort was the goal, he was transitioned back to nasal cannula,\nand oxygen saturations were no longer followed.\n\n3) Nutrition/Protein Loss: Initially the patient was allowed to\neat a regular diet but in attempts at medical management he was\nconverted to a low fat, high protein diet and then made NPO with\nTPN. Despite TPN his protein and albumin continued to fall\npresumably due to losses in the chest tube.   After he became\nquite volume overloaded on [**2196-11-27**] and given the minimal\nreduction in fluid output seen even with the TPN modifications\nTPN was stopped as of [**11-27**] and he was allowed to eat for\ncomfort.  He and his family understand he will ultimately\ncontinue to become malnourished and weaker but given poor\ntoleration of TPN and comfort focused care this was considered\nacceptable by them.\n\n4) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: The patient was noted to\nhave intermittently elevated white counts and on [**2196-11-19**] had a\nright upper lobe infiltrate on chest radiograph and had purulent\nsputum.  Therefore, he received 9 days of cefepime/vancomycin\nwith some improvement in his sputum production and stable chest\nradiograph findings.  White count failed to trend reliably. He\nwas never febrile.\n\n5) LLE DVT: He was initially on heparin gtt then transitioned to\nbe therapeutic on coumadin.  He was transferred back to heparin\ngtt once on the medical service and continued on this throughout\nhis course there to make procedures feasible without needing a\nlong warfarin wash-out. Anticoagulation with medications other\nthan unfractionated heparin (enoxaparin, warfarin) was not\noptimal given his renal failure and poor nutritional status.\n\n6)Cellulitis: The patient initially received a dose of\npenicillin then a few days of cefazolin with minimal improvement\nin his abdominal rash.  He then received 10 days of vancomycin\nas well as steroid cream after dermatology thought the abdominal\nrash could be a contact dermatitis.  This led to resolution of\nhis abdominal rash.\n\n7) Likely drug rash: Later in his hospitalization (around\n[**11-19**]-15th) he developed a morbilliform eruption on his\ntrunk in the context of receiving a dose of\npiperacillin-tazobactam in the ICU.  This medication was stopped\nan his rash resolved.\n\n8) Hypotension: The patient developed relative hypotension in\nthe hospital.  Multiple blood cultures were negative and this\nseemed stable without mental status changes or end organ\ndysfunction (except some worsening of his CKD).  This was\nthought likely due to poor cardiac return due to massive third\nspacing from his protein losses and perhaps external compression\nof the IVC by his abdomen.\n\n9) Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's baseline Cr is unclear.\nAt presentation Cr was 2 then trended down to 1.5 before\ntrending up again in the setting of worsening ascites and his\ngeneral deterioration.  Renal was consulted twice and ultimately\nconcluded this was likely due to poor preload and forward flow\nfrom the heart in the context of his third spacing and massive\nabdominal distension.  He never became oliguric or anuric.\n\n10) Atrial fibrillation: The patient developed atrial\nfibrillation with rapid ventricular response while his nodal\nagents were being held.  This broke with diltiazem and he was\nrestarted on this medication with good rate control.\n\n11) Goals of Care: After extensive discussion with the family\nand patient about the lack of options for reversing the\npatient's chylous ascites accumulation and subsequent\nrespiratory compromise and progressive protein wasting they\nelected to pursue comfort focused care.  Reasonably benign\ninterventions (i.e. antibiotics, pleurodesis through a\npreexisting chest tube) were pursued but other aggressive cares\nwere not.  Similarly oral feeds were pursued even in the face of\na possible SBO for the patient's comfort and happiness.  His\nmajor goal was comfort and the family and patient understood his\npoor prognosis. When his respiratory status deteriorated on\n[**11-30**] (as above), further diagnostics and interventions were not\npursued, and he was given morphine. He passed away in the\nevening of [**11-30**], and his family was notified.

Vascular\nsurgery evaluated the patient and thought that treatment for the\ninfection and ischemia would be a below the knee amputation,\nthough given the patient's poor cardiac status, he would not be\na good candidate for surgery. The patient was empirically\nstarted on Vancomycin and Zosyn. A wound culture grew Klebsiella\noxytoca and MRSA and continued on those antibiotics. Since\nvascular surgery would be high risk, podiatry was consulted for\nlocal debridement. They debrided the area locally, yet erythema\nof the right foot existed. It remained unclear whether the\nerythema was due to ischemia vs. a subcutaneous abscess, so they\nrecommended a MRI of the foot. The MRI was never performed\nbecause after discussion with the family and primary care\nphysician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was decided for the patient to become CMO. His\nantibiotics were withdrawn and wound care applied to the area.\n\n# Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient presented with a\ncreatinine close to his baseline, however, after periods of\nhypotension, likely due to a peri-septic state, his creatinine\nstarting to rise. He was given fluid boluses of 500 cc of normal\nsaline as needed because his urine lytes showed a FeUrea~20-25%.\nRenal was consulted and thought his creatinine rise was likely\ndue to acute tubular necrosis secondary to a pre-renal state.\nThe patient was offered aluminium hydroxide for high phosphate\nlevels, but the patient refused it. A renal ultrasound showed no\nhydronephrosis. The patient became progressively oliguric with\nUOP less than 20 cc/hour. Renal thought his kidneys would\nunlikely recover (his creatinine rose to 5.3 despite\ninterventions). The patient and his family felt that they did\nnot want to pursue dialysis as an option.\n\n#Increased troponins: The patient was noted to have high\ntroponins and excentuated ST wave depressions in V3-V5.\nCardiology was consulted and recommended medical management with\na beta blocker, ACE inhibitor, statin, and aspirin. The patient\nwas started on these medications, though became persistently\nhyperkalemic, and therefore, the ACEi was discontinued. Also,\nhis CK and LFTs were [**Last Name (LF) 28645**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] the statin dose of 80 mg was\nlowered to 20 mg and eventually discontinued due to persistently\n[**First Name3 (LF) 28645**] LFTs. An echocardiogram revealed no acute wall motion\nabnormality, though it did show worsening tricuspid\nregurgitation and increased pulmonary artery pressure.\nThroughout his stay, the patient did not have any chest pain.\n\n#Increased LFTs: The patient has a known history of alcohol\nabuse and increased LFTs in the past. During his peri-septic\nperiod, the patient was noted to have increased LFTs, likely\nmultifactorial due to low perfusion to the liver and also\ncongestion secondary to tricuspid regurgitation. The patient did\nnot have any complaints of abdominal pain, though, he had\nhepatomegaly on exam.\n\n#Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has a history of a GI bleed\nand was guiaic positive in the ER. In addition, he had a\npersistently elevated PT/PTT, likely due to either underlying\nliver or hematologic disease. The patient's hematocrit remained\nstable until [**9-26**] when his hematocrit dropped from 29.0 to 25.6\nand was noted to have melenic stools. He continued to have\nmelenic stools, so he was transfused one unit of blood and\ntransferred to the MICU. His aspirin was discontinued. His\nhematocrit remained stable in the MICU and transferred to the\nfloors where there were no signs of any GI bleeding.\n\nAltered mental status: The patient had periods where he had\naltered mental status, mostly at night. His AMS was likely\nmultifactorial due to infection, pain and uremia. He had\nsignificant altered mental status on one day when he appeared\nmore somnolent with respirations=10/min after a dose of Morphine\n2mg IV. Narcane was given with some effect. A head CT showed no\nacute pathology. He continued to have periods of delirium mostly\nat night.\n\n#Pruritis: The patient has been complaining of pruritis,\nespecially on his back, since admission. A variety of remedies\nwere tried for wound care. According to his son, the pruritis\nhas been long-standing. It might be exacerbated by his renal\nfailure. A side effect of Morphine is a possibility, but he\nstill had the itching even before the morphine. He is being\ntreated with skin care, sarna lotion, hydrocortisone and\ndoxepin.\n\nGoals of care: The patient entered the hospital as full code.\nAfter the renal and GI bleeding complications from his illness,\nthe patient and his family decided to become DNR/DNI. After a\nmeeting with the PCP and the family, they thought the best route\nwould be to become comfort measures only instead of pursuing\ndialysis and being chronically cared for in a nursing home. At\nfirst, it was thought that his beta blocker, aspirin, and\nantibiotics would be continued, however, after further\nconversation, these medications were discontinued and only\npalliative measures for insomnia, anxiety, pain and constipation\nwere ordered."", 'abuse', 1)]}","dict_keys(['Allergies', 'History of Present Illness', 'Social History', '# Right lower extremity cellulitis and right foot osteomyelitis'])"

The morning following\nadmission she had an episode of decreased responsiveness, clonic\njerks, lip smacking and hand automatisms. She was evaluated by\nneurology and was given Ativan and Depakote for complex partial\nseizure. Approximately 1 hour after this she became unresponsive\nand her tongue was swollen.  She was intubated for airway\nprotection due to angioedema.

The patient required daily dialysis from\n[**Date range (3) 45315**] and her mental status normalized and was stable\nfor several days at discharge.\n\n2. Angioedema/respiratory failure: Her tongue was noted to be\nswollen prior to the administration of Depakote during\nsuctioning prior to intubation.  The angioedema seemed to\ncorrelate with the Ativan administration. There is a report of\nangioedema in the past, attributed to Dilantin--but she received\nAtivan at that time as well.  She was treated for 24 hours with\nsteroids with remarkable improvement.  Her lisinopril was also\ndiscontinued.  Her intubation was for airway protection in the\nsetting of altered mental status and angioedema. She had\npersistent apneic episodes on the ventilator and never developed\na cuff leak.

She was dialyzed daily in the MICU from [**Date range (1) 45316**]\nthen returned to her scheduled of T/T/Saturday.\n\n5. Atrial fibrillation: Rate control with metoprolol. She had a\nsingle episode of RVR in the ED prior to admission which\nresponded to labetalol, otherwise, she was effectively rate\ncontrolled.  Her INR was subtherapeutic at admission, but was\ntherapeutic at discharge.  Her INR will need to be followed in\nrehabilitation and outpatient monitoring set up prior to\ndischarge home.\n\n6. Abdominal Pain: likely post operative, waxed and waned on\nthis admission.  At the time of discharge, the pain was\ncontrolled by Tylenol.

Course was complicated by\nRP bleed, s/p IR embolization of R renal artery [**2112-11-17**], PNA\ns/p course of Vanc/Zosyn/Tobra, and inability to clear his own\nsecretions with subsequent recurrent mucus plugging and chronic\naspiration, leading to episodes of hypoxic respiratory distress.\n.\n# Seizures: The patient had a witnessed event in which he had\nwhole-body shaking and was non-responsive. DDx for seizure\nprecipitant includes metabolic etiology such as [**2-24**] hypoglycemia\nvs. infection vs. medication non-compliance. Not likely acute\nintracranial process as no changed on CT head w/o. No reason to\nbelieve that the patient has been missing his medications, per\nfamily and daycare. He has no complaints, and no s/s of\ninfection (no fever, symptoms, and CXR w/no focal infiltrate),\nwhich could also precipitate seizures. Per reviewing [**Name (NI) **], pt has\nbeen admitted frequently for these seizures every few months.\nThe ED [**Name (NI) 653**] pt\'s outpt Neurologist who recommended\nincreasing Keppra dose to 1500mg [**Hospital1 **] and continuing 500mg after\nHD and checking a level.  Keppra level was obtained but pending\nas it is a send out. Oxcarbazepine 150mg [**Hospital1 **] continued.\nTreatment of hypoglycemia as below.\n.\n# Hypoglycemia: Pt presented with significant hypoglycemia of\nunknown etiology. There is no evidence of iatrogenic cause of\nhypoglycemia.  Workup included fasting C-peptide and insulin\nlevel, which were non-diagnostic given the venous glucose for\nthe specimen was not less than 50.  There was no evidence of\nadrenal insufficiency.  His hypoglycemia resolved after RP bleed\nfor unclear reasons.\n.\n# Aspiration: Pt has a documented history of chronic aspiration\nlikely secondary to his CVA, and has been evaluated by speech\nand swallow multiple times in the past.  Pt was found to be at\nincreased risk for aspiration.  However, family in the past had\ninsisted on continued feeding, regardless of aspiration risk.\nIn [**Month (only) **], speech and swallow commented that ""As aspiration\nrisks are similar across consistencies, pt comfort should be\ndeciding factor in diet order"".  Pt was placed on mechanical\nsoft diet/dysphagia diet on admission, as quality of life was\nconsidered to be the number one priority by the family.  During\nthis admission, pt was found to have significant worsening\naspiration, manifested by copious secretions in airway.  He had\nmultiple episodes of desatting both in the MICU and on the\nregular floor.  He collapsed his right lung several times in the\nsetting of mucus plugging.  For all these episodes, he responded\nwell with suction and chest PT.  After lengthy discussion with\nfamily, decision was made to feed the patient despite the\naspiration risk. A PEG tube was deferred given successful eating\nwithout obvious aspiration.\n.\n# Fistula thrombosis/Access: Following his stay in the ICU the\npatient had a thrombosed fistula.  The level of thrombosis was\ntoo much for vascular or for IR to open the fistula.  He had a\ntemporary line placed that was converted to a tunneled catheter\nfor dialysis and IR was able to place a PICC for further access\nvia venogram.  He will be discharged on a heparin\ndrip-to-warfarin bridge for this thrombosis and a\ncatheter-associated thrombus in the right IJ.\n.\n# Line infection: The patient had pus noted around his right IJ\nfollowing his time in the ICU.  Cultures subsequently grew\nresistant Klebsiella and coagulase negative gram positive cocci,\nalong with confirmation from 1 subsequent blood culture.  He\nwill be treated for a total of two weeks with vancomycin and\ncefepime, to be completed on [**2112-12-20**].\n\n# Retroperitoneal bleed with subsequent anemia: Pt was found to\nhave tachycardia and hypotension on HD#7, with a 9-point HCT\ndrop.  He underwent CTA, and was found to have multifocal\nretroperitoneal bleed in the right kidney.  He was admitted to\nMICU and intubated for airway protection.  Pt had a total of 9\nunits pRBC.  Transcatheter embolization of the right kidney was\nperformed and hemodynamic stability was achieved.  Subsequently,\nhis hematocrit continued to run low, requiring intermittent\ntransfusions of RBCs at dialysis, with a nadir of 19.9.\nNephrology will be assessing whether he should be started on\nEpogen at dialysis.\n.\n# Pneumonia: Pt was found to have pneumonia on MICU day 4, with\nleukocytosis and\nfever.  The etiology of pneumonia was HCAP vs VAP.  He was\ntreated with vanco, zosyn and tobra for a total of 9 days.
